# Pac Man Maze
 Mainly utilizing ArrayList's and JFrame, I created a side by side 2D and 3D maze.

 As a player plays through the maze, the 3D representation updates along with the 2D maze giving 2 different perspectives for every moves.The game keeps track of the players time to completion as well as the amount of moves a player makes. 

 Added two special feature :
1. In order to beat the maze, the player must find the cherry object which serves as the key to unlock the exit.
2. If the player obtains the ghost, 10 steps are taken off their step counter.
